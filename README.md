Simulation of Pressurised Water Reactor and attached Steam Turbine for Power Generation

This simulation represents a rather basic model of a 3500MW(thermal) Pressurised Water Nuclear Reactor and associated Steam Turbine for power generation.\
\
It is still very much a work in progress but currently can simulate operation of a PWR reactor from mode 5 condition (cold shut down) until mode 1 (on load) and up to full load.
